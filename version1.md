Medium Spender Proposal Draft 1.0

Title: Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship: Initial Funding Request
Date: 5 November 2024 
Proposer(s): Lucy Coulden, DonDiego Sanchez
Amount Requested (USDT): 580,000 USDT
Multi-Sig Wallet Address: XXX

Purpose: Establishment and incubation of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship.


Summary 
This proposal outlines the funding strategy for the launch and initial phase of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship, focusing on three main areas: salaries, an interim Sub-Treasury, and an interim Optimistic Fund.
The interim sub-treasury will cover essential operational needs, such as tools (G-Suite, Discord), ambassador merchandise and emergency expenses. It is designed to mirror how the fully operational fellowship will be funded once it's up and running, with spending decisions made through the Fellowship's internal voting system. The funds allocated during this incubation period will help gauge the ongoing financial needs of the fellowship, with the main Polkadot treasury stepping in to replenish the sub-treasury once the program is fully established.
The interim Optimistic Fund is intended to replicate the future Optimistic Fund system, which will provide financial support to key initiatives within the fellowship. During this initial phase, the fellowship will fund selected verticals, ranging from governance initiatives to regional Ambassador programs. The process for distributing these funds, which will eventually involve a community vote, is being tested to ensure it functions effectively when the full fellowship is launched.
The Operational Committee will oversee the creation and leadership of the Ambassador Fellowship during the incubation phase. Their responsibilities include onboarding ambassadors, setting up communication and collaboration tools, establishing performance metrics, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. An Advisory Board of respected figures from the Polkadot ecosystem will be formed to provide strategic guidance on critical decisions that cannot wait for formal governance processes. 
Additionally, the program will launch 10 specialist verticals as a test next for the incubation period. These verticals will focus on areas currently crucial to Polkadot's success, such as regional Ambassador initiatives, external partnerships, and Governance projects. They will serve as a testbed for how the fellowship will function once fully operational, with their success measured against predefined KPIs.
In sum, this funding plan is designed to support the initial establishment of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship while also testing its long-term operational needs. By funding key areas such as operations, leadership, and vertical initiatives, the plan lays the groundwork for a sustainable and impactful program within the broader Polkadot ecosystem.

Funding Breakdown

The interim treasury for the establishment and incubation of the Ambassador Fellowship is expected to cover three cost areas, salaries, interim Sub-Treasury and interim Optimistic Fund. 

Interim Sub-Treasury

Request: 10,000 USD per month for four months; Total: 40,000 USD

The Ambassador Fellowship programme has an on-chain treasury which will be used to provide tooling for the Fellowship and cover any incidental costs. The top-up amount and frequency will be agile, depending on the need. The required funds and top-ups will be requested via OpenGov, based on the process set by the Ambassador Fellowship. The use of the funds once in the treasury will be decided through the internal Fellowship voting system. Examples of what the Ambassador sub-treasury would be used for:

Tooling such as G-Suite, Element, Discord, premium membership for apps and social media channels.
Specialist merchandise for Ambassadors
Operational emergencies 

When the Ambassador Fellowship is fully operational, the treasury attached to the pallet will be topped up by the main Polkadot treasury and spent as described above. We will be mimicking that funding by requesting a similar amount for this period. This will allow us to test the waters as to how much will be required by the Ambassador Fellowship on an ongoing basis. For the purposes of the interim treasury, spending in the establishment period will be decided upon by the Operational Committee and Advisory Board.  

Interim Optimistic Fund

Request: 54 Operating Blocks (OpBlocks) for four months; Total: 540,000 USD. 24 OpBlocks for the establishment and incubation of the programme. 30 OpBlocks for the specialist vertical programmes.

As with the sub-treasury, the funds will be used to mimic the Optimistic Fund which will be being built during this time. The phragmen voting system will be replaced by the Operational Committee and Advisory Board. We will begin with a small number of specialist verticals and individuals to be funded by this method which cover a range of possible verticals in order to demonstrate to the community how the system will work and gauge how many OpBlocks we should start with when the Fund opens.
	
This is how the Optimistic Funding process will work when it is actively used by the Ambassador Fellowship:

Each Optimistic Block (OpBlock) is valued at $10,000.
The community votes periodically on how many OpBlox should be available each month, which will then be filled out automatically by the main Polkadot Treasury.
All DOT holders can apply to the Optimistic Fund. The applicant should be from Rank I-VI for a proposal related to the Ambassador Fellowship programme. 
Applicants can apply for multiple OpBlocks at one time.
Elections happen at equal intervals. The length will be determined as necessary to benefit Polkadot's needs.
Those elected get access to spend up to USD 10,000 from the treasury during their election period. 
Each spend has a required text memo field where the Ambassador describes what the funds are used for.
Elected individuals do not need to spend all the money, and spending the money is not a default operation.
Elected individuals can send money to their verified wallet for payment, salary, compensation or reward.
Elections occur on-chain, so Ambassadors need not appeal to anyone except DOT holders.
DOT holders can update their nominations based on the memos and spending history of individuals.
DOT holders can update any parameters based on the ecosystem's needs.

If the Ambassador Fellowship is a success in that first quarter, the funds can remain in the sub-treasury for future use. If not, the funds will be returned to the main Polkadot treasury.

Leadership

Operating Committee
21 OpBlocks in total; 210,000 USD in total across four months; equivalent of 100 USD per hour
Role: the establishment of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship in December 2024 and leadership during the incubation phase, Q1 2025. 
Key responsibilities:
Complete initial seeding of Ambassadors from Ranks I-IV.
Onboard 100 Ambassador at Rank 0 during Q1 2025.
Select specialist verticals to operate during the incubation period.
Establish a framework to assess the program’s effectiveness and ensure continuous improvement.
Specify how real-time collaboration tools will be utilised to maintain constant dialogue between Ambassadors and Ambassadors and the Polkadot community, especially across time zones. 
Select, set-up and manage the tools best suited for the Fellowship
Create a culture of collaboration within the programme. Introduce regular Town Halls for Ambassadors to provide feedback on program initiatives, content, and challenges. This ensures a continuous improvement loop that adapts to evolving community needs.
Establish the specialist verticals that focus internally on the Fellowship:
Ambassador Development and Recognition 
Programme Impact and Success 
Recruitment and retention 
Monthly time commitment: the equivalent of three full-time Programme Directors; we suggest one full-time and four part-time based on the availability of individuals who have helped to build this community programme and want to dedicate their time to its construction. Although the salary is calculated as 40 hours per week, these roles are highly skilled, will be intense and likely require additional hours for the duration of this period. 

Advisory Board
3 OpBlocks in total; 30,000 USD in total across four months; equivalent to 100 USD per hour.
Role: to provide advice and guidance to the Operational Committee on decisions that (1) are critical to the establishment of the programme and cannot go through OpenGov due to the nature of the decision or time restrictions and (2) would be voted on using the phragmen system when it has been established.
Monthly time commitment: 1,000 USD per month for each Advisor. Each advisor is expected to contribute 10 working hours per month for four months.
Selection Process: we have asked seven members of the Polkadot ecosystem that provide a cross-section of expertise and represent different corners of the community. All of those that we have approached have a long history within the ecosystem and are well-known and highly respected for their contributions. These are amongst the most trusted members of the ecosystem and will form a solid backbone for the programme along with the Operating Committee Directors. 

Specialist Verticals

We will be selecting 10 verticals to establish and operate during the incubation period. These verticals will be representative of a cross-section of the verticals that Polkadot currently needs to support operations and will showcase the best of what the Fellowship will produce when it is fully up and running. Examples of the diverse verticals we will look to support during this initial phase with this funding:

Solo operating Ambassadors - Individuals carrying out a wide range of activities.
Geographical initiatives - i.e. LATAM, SE Asia, Eastern Europe
External partnership initiatives - i.e. BD helpdesk.
Governance initiatives - i.e. promoting Polkadot’s decentralised governance model and empowering communities to participate actively.
Developer Relations initiative 

Each selected vertical will get three OpBlocks in Q1, one per month; USD 30,000 in total. They will all be assessed and success measured based on the objectives and KPIs set at the start of the programme.
