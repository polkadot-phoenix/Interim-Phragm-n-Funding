Project Phoenix: Medium Spender Proposal Draft 2.0

Title: Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship: Initial Funding Request
Date: 5 November 2024 
Proposer(s): Lucy Coulden, DonDiego Sanchez, Lorena Fabris
Amount Requested (USDT): 640,000 USDT
Multi-Sig Wallet Address: XXX

Purpose: Establishment of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship and deployment of an interim funding phase.



Overview 


This proposal outlines the funding strategy for the launch and initial phase of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship, focusing on two areas: the Ambassador Fellowship Sub-Treasury, and an interim Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn Voting. 

We are requesting USDT 640,000.00. 

The Interim Sub-Treasury: USDT 40,000.00  
This will cover essential operational needs, such as tools (G-Suite, Discord), ambassador merchandise and emergency expenses. 

The interim Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn Voting - USDT 600,000.00
This will fund a test run to replicate the future Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn voting system, which will provide financial support to key initiatives within the Polkadot Network. During this initial phase, 15 Opblocks will be allocated to various initiatives. The process for distributing these funds will be overseen by the advisory board. 


Funds will be held on a multisig composed of XXX. 

All unused funds will be returned to the treasury at the end of the four month period. 

This funding plan is designed to support the initial establishment of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship while also testing its long-term operational needs. By funding key areas such as operations, leadership, and vertical initiatives, the plan lays the groundwork for a sustainable and impactful program within the broader Polkadot ecosystem.




Funding

Implementing the new Ambassador Fellowship pallet and the Phragmén election-based funding mechanism will require time and careful deployment. To maintain momentum within the Ambassador Program and deliver immediate results for the Polkadot Network, we propose an interim funding phase. This phase will bridge the gap, enabling us to refine and test processes before committing them to code.
During this interim period—projected to last four months—the Ambassador Fellowship will operate with processes that closely mimic the dynamics planned for the future pallet. Temporarily, an Advisory Board will stand in for Token Holders, managing decisions on funding allocation, expense validation, and slot efficiency oversight. This Advisory Board will play a crucial role in ensuring transparent and effective operations until the finalised mechanism is in place.
Furthermore, the interim phase will encourage community involvement. During the referendum voting period, any community member will have the opportunity to propose their own initiative for funding consideration. The submission process is outlined below.
Interim Sub-Treasury

Request: 10,000 USD per month for four months; 
Total: 40,000 USD

The Ambassador Fellowship programme has an on-chain treasury which will be used to provide tooling for the Fellowship and cover any incidental costs. The top-up amount and frequency will be agile, depending on the need. The required funds and top-ups will be requested via OpenGov, based on the process set by the Ambassador Fellowship. The use of the funds once in the treasury will be decided through the internal Fellowship voting system. Examples of what the Ambassador sub-treasury would be used for:

Tooling such as G-Suite, Element, Discord, premium membership for apps and social media channels.
Branding and marketing
Specialist merchandise for Ambassadors
Operational emergencies 

When the Ambassador Fellowship is fully operational, the treasury attached to the pallet will be topped up by the main Polkadot treasury and spent as described above. We will be mimicking that funding by requesting a similar amount for this period. This will allow us to test the waters as to how much will be required by the Ambassador Fellowship on an ongoing basis. For the purposes of the interim treasury, spending in the establishment period will be decided upon by the Advisory Board.  

Interim Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn Voting

Request: 15 Optimistic Blocks (OpBlocks) per month, 60 OpBlocks in four months; 
Total: 600,000 USD. 

As with the sub-treasury, the funds will be used to mimic the Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn Voting, which will be being built during this time. We will begin with a small number of Opblocks to demonstrate to the community how the system will work and gauge how many OpBlocks we should start with when the Fund opens.

This funding mechanism is designed to support a diverse range of initiatives, including:
Solo Operating Ambassadors; Full-Time
A full-time Solo Operating Ambassador may request funding equivalent to a full-time position (40 hours per week) by applying for one or multiple OpBlocks. This role requires the Ambassador’s exclusive dedication to the Polkadot Network and the Ambassador Fellowship, with no other commitments or external funding inside the ecosystem. Any funded commitments outside of the ecosystem must be declared upon application for OpBlocks.
Solo Operating Ambassadors; Part-Time
A part-time Solo Operating Ambassador may seek funding proportional to a part-time role (20 hours per week), either through a single or shared OpBlock arrangement with another part-time Ambassador. This Ambassador may hold additional commitments and receive funding from other sources inside (up to a further 20 hours per week) or outside of the ecosystem, provided they fulfil their obligations to token holders and deliver measurable results for the program.
Groups of Ambassadors
In this model, a group of Ambassadors collaborates to undertake a specific initiative. They may request one or more OpBlocks, depending on the project scope. While no individual commitment is required from each member, the group as a whole is expected to deliver meaningful results and make a positive impact.
DAOs / Communities
Domestic or thematic communities (such as DAOs) may apply for funding, requesting one or more OpBlocks as needed. The primary expectation from these groups is the achievement of clear results that align with the program’s objectives.


OpBlocks Allocation 

This proposal aims to initiate the first of the 15 available slots by funding the Advisory Board  itself. This initial slot will allocate USDT 10,000.00 per month to the members of the Advisory Board. The primary role of the Advisory Board will be to select the recipients for the remaining 14 slots.
1) Applications
Individual Ambassadors, groups, or communities interested in applying for one or more of the 15 slots will be invited to complete the application form, available on the Phoenix-Project GitHub repository. Applicants will have 21 days from the publication date of this referendum to submit their applications.
2) Selection Process
After the 21-day application period, the Advisory Committee will have a 14-day window to review and select the slot recipients. The final selections are expected to be announced by the conclusion of the referendum voting period. Given the temporary nature of this process, the Advisory Board is not required to provide justifications for their choices, allowing flexibility for these busy committee members to make efficient decisions.
3) Expense Reporting and Accountability
In preparation for the future implementation of the Phragmèn system, selected members will be required to document and justify their expenses. The Advisory Board will oversee this accountability process and hold the authority to maintain, remove, or replace a slot recipient if necessary.
OpBlock 1: Advisory Board 

Role: to provide advice and guidance to the Operational Committee (OpCom) on decisions that (1) are critical to the establishment of the programme and cannot go through OpenGov due to the nature of the decision or time restrictions and (2) would be voted on using the Phragmèn system when it has been established.
Monthly time commitment: 1,000 USD per month for each Advisor. Each advisor is expected to contribute 10 working hours per month for four months.
Selection Process: we have asked ten members of the Polkadot ecosystem that provide a cross-section of expertise and represent different corners of the community. All of those that we have approached have a long history within the ecosystem and are well-known and highly respected for their contributions. These are amongst the most trusted members of the ecosystem and will form a solid backbone for the programme along with the Operating Committee Director and Leads. 

OpBlock 2-5: Interim Program Director & Interim Program Leads 


Role: the establishment of the Polkadot Ambassador Fellowship in December 2024 and leadership during the incubation phase, Q1 2025. 
Key responsibilities:
Complete initial seeding of Ambassadors from Ranks I-IV.
Onboard 100 Ambassador at Rank 0 during Q1 2025.
Select specialist verticals to operate during the incubation period.
Establish a framework to assess the program’s effectiveness and ensure continuous improvement.
Specify how real-time collaboration tools will be utilised to maintain constant dialogue between Ambassadors and Ambassadors and the Polkadot community, especially across time zones. 
Select, set-up and manage the tools best suited for the Fellowship
Create a culture of collaboration within the programme. Introduce regular Town Halls for Ambassadors to provide feedback on program initiatives, content, and challenges. This ensures a continuous improvement loop that adapts to evolving community needs.
Establish the specialist verticals that focus internally on the Fellowship:
Ambassador Development and Recognition 
Programme Impact and Success 
Recruitment and retention 
Monthly time commitment: the equivalent of two full-time Programme Directors. These roles are highly skilled, will be intense and require additional hours for the duration of this period. 


OpBlock 6-15: Specialist Verticals

These will be subject to the submission process outlined above and OpBlocks may be split in two (USDT 5,000.00 for each recipient) as a testing ground for what will best serve the ecosystem when the Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn Voting is active.

Seeding
In December 2024, an initial cohort of 50 Ambassadors, spanning Ranks I through IV, will be formally inducted as part of the Ambassador Fellowship’s establishment phase. This selection process will adhere strictly to the ranking methodology specified in the Ambassador Fellowship Manifesto. Final decisions regarding seeding will be made by the OpCom in conjunction with the Advisory Board, with advisory support from members of the Technical Fellowship.
Following this initial seeding, Fellowship membership will open to all applicants beginning in January. A key objective for the OpCom during this incubation period will be the onboarding of 100 Advocate Ambassadors (Rank 0), thereby broadening the Fellowship’s reach and establishing a strong foundation for its future impact.

Appendix

This is how the Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn Voting process will work when it is actively used by the Ambassador Fellowship:

Each OpBlock is valued at USD 10,000.00.
The community votes periodically on how many OpBlox should be available each month, which will then be filled out automatically by the main Polkadot Treasury.
All DOT holders can apply to the Optimistic Fund with Phragmèn Voting. The applicant should be from Rank I-VI for a proposal related to the Ambassador Fellowship programme. 
Applicants can apply for multiple OpBlocks at one time.
Elections happen at equal intervals. The length will be determined as necessary to benefit Polkadot's needs.
Those elected get access to spend up to USD 10,000.00 from the treasury during their election period. 
Each spend has a required text memo field where the Ambassador describes what the funds are used for.
Elected individuals do not need to spend all the money, and spending the money is not a default operation.
Elected individuals can send money to their verified wallet for payment, salary, compensation or reward.
Elections occur on-chain, so Ambassadors need not appeal to anyone except DOT holders.
DOT holders can update their nominations based on the memos and spending history of individuals.
DOT holders can update any parameters based on the ecosystem's needs.
